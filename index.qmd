## Background

- [Health literacy]{style="color: blue;"} is broadly defined as the ability to access, understand, appraise, and communicate health information, enabling individuals to engage in healthcare and maintain good health throughout their lives.

- [UCL Public Policy Fellowship]{style="color: blue;"}

##

- Focusses on [Newham]{style="color: blue;"}, a diverse borough in East London that faces unique challenges
- Identified as having some of the lowest levels of health literacy in the UK by University of Southampton (https://healthliteracy.geodata.uk/)

## Previous method: Synthetic estimation

- Weighted Logistic Regression with Synthetic Estimation (@laursen2016developing)
    - Frequentist single-level regression with poststratification
- Used in geography (@gonzalez1973use; @rao2015small)
- Can be viewed as the simpler predecessor to MRP
    - Ignores any unique local factors
    - MRP includes shrinkage via random effects
- A linear model can be thought of equivalent to [Regression-Synthetic Estimator at Unit Level]{style="color: blue;"}
    - Like Simulated Treatment Comparison in HTA
- [Residual-adjusted synthetic estimation]{style="color: blue;"} similar to [Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE)]{style="color: blue;"} in causal inference


## Problem

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- What are the 'drivers' of health literacy, [specific]{style="color: blue;"} to Newham?
- Can we [quantify]{style="color: blue;"} them?
- What would happen to health literacy if we were to [intervene]{style="color: blue;"} to effect one of these?

## Data

- Newham Residents Survey 2023 (NRS)

- Skills for Life Survey 2011

- Additional data
    - Labour Force Survey (LFS) 
    - UK Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) 2023
    - Skills for Life Survey 2003

## Mutlilevel regression and post-stratification

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

The predicted probability $\hat{\pi}_i$ is defined as:
$$
\hat{\pi}_i = \text{logit}^{-1} \left( \hat{\beta}_0 + \sum_{x} \hat{\beta}^{x}_{\gamma_x[i]} \right)
$$

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
where $\hat{\beta}_0$ is the intercept, $\hat{\beta}^{x}_{\gamma_x[i]}$ are coefficients for covariates $x$ (age, sex, eng, white, ukborn, qual, inc, job, work, home), and $\gamma_x[i]$ represents the level or category for covariate $x$ for individual $i$. IMD is included as multilevel random effects $\beta^{\text{IMD}}_j \sim \text{N}(\mu_{\text{IMD}}, \sigma_{\text{IMD}}^2)$.
Priors distributions for fixed effects are normal distributions centered at zero with modest variance, and half-normal priors are used for random effect standard deviations \cite{gelman2006}.
:::

##

The health literacy probabilities for each demographic category (cell $c$) are weighted by their proportion in the actual Newham population. With 11 covariates resulting in $|\mathcal{S}|$ = 13,824 cells, the post-stratified estimate $\hat{\pi}^{\text{mrp}}$ is:
$$
\hat{\pi}^{\text{mrp}} = \sum_{c = 1}^{|\mathcal{S}|} w_c \hat{\pi}_{c}
$$
where $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of all covariate combinations, $N_c$ is the population frequency for cell $c$, $N$ is the total population size, and $w_c = N_{c} / N$ are the combination weights.


## Predictive comparisons :thinking:

- Terminology borrow from @Gelman
- Like [average treatment effects]{style="color: blue;"} without the causal interpretation

## Raking


## Priority ranking

- SUCRA taken from network meta-analysis (NMA)

## Main results :thumbsup:

-   [Performance]{style="color: blue;"}: Generated code can be highly optimized for a specific task, as it doesn't need to carry the overhead of conditional logic for other scenarios.


## Sensitivity analyses :thumbsup:

-   [Easier Maintenance]{style="color: blue;"}: You maintain one core piece of code. Changes to the underlying logic only need to be applied in one place.
