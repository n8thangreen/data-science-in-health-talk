## Background

-   Project title: **Assessed  the factors that determine health literacy and the size of their influence/impact for Newham** 

-   [Health literacy]{style="color: blue;"} is broadly defined as the ability to access, understand, appraise, and communicate health information, enabling individuals to engage in healthcare and maintain good health throughout their lives.


## 

-   Focusses on [Newham]{style="color: blue;"}, a diverse borough in East London that faces unique challenges
-   Identified as having some of the [lowest levels]{style="color: blue;"} of health literacy in the UK by University of Southampton (https://healthliteracy.geodata.uk/)

## Previous method: Synthetic estimation

-   Weighted Logistic Regression with Synthetic Estimation (@laursen2016developing)
    -   Frequentist single-level regression with poststratification
-   Used in geography (@gonzalez1973use; @rao2015small)
-   Can be viewed as the simpler predecessor to [Multilevel Regression with Post-stratification (MRP)]{style="color: blue;"}
    -   Ignores any unique local factors
    -   MRP includes shrinkage via random effects


## Some (rough) comparisons


| Small Area Estimation (SAE) | | HTA / Statistics Method |
| :---- | :--: | :--- |
| Weighted Logistic Regression with Synthetic Estimation<br><br><ul><li>Ignores any unique local factors</li></ul> | $\longrightarrow$ | Multilevel Regression with Post-stratification (MRP)<br><ul><li>Includes shrinkage via random effects</li></ul> |
| Linear Plug-In Model<br>*(Equivalent to Regression-Synthetic Estimator at Unit Level)* | $\longrightarrow$ | Simulated Treatment Comparison (STC) |
| Residual-adjusted synthetic estimation | $\longrightarrow$ | Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE)<br>*(in causal inference)* |

## Problem

-   What are the ['drivers']{style="color: blue;"} of health literacy?
-   Can we [quantify]{style="color: blue;"} them? [Specific]{style="color: blue;"} to Newham?
-   What would happen to health literacy if we were to [intervene]{style="color: blue;"} to effect one of these?


## Data

-   **Newham Residents Survey 2023 (NRS)**
    * Periodic survey, usually every two years
    * Detailed information on views, experiences, and needs of Newham residents
    * Covers satisfaction with local services, community safety, health and well-being, housing, and employment

-   **Skills for Life (SfL) Survey 2011**
    * Comprehensive computer-based assessment conducted by the ONS to evaluate the skills of literacy, numeracy, and ICT
    * Total 7230 adults in England
    
-   Additional data

    -   Labour Force Survey (LFS) / Annual Population Survey (APS)
    -   UK Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) 2023
    -   Skills for Life Survey 2003
    -   UK Census 2011, 2021

## Health literacy definition

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- From @rowlands2015
- Sample of health materials, including
    * medicine labels
    * booklets
    * application forms
- Covered themes of health promotion, managing illness, systems navigation and disease prevention
- Assessed for literacy and numeracy complexity by [education experts]{style="color: blue;"}
- SfL responses were mapped to the binary health literacy scale according to whether they are [above or below threshold]{style="color: blue;"}

## [Mutlilevel Regression]{style="color: blue;"} and Post-stratification

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
The predicted probability defined as: $$
\hat{\pi}_i = \text{logit}^{-1} \left( \hat{\beta}_0 + \sum_{x} \hat{\beta}^{x}_{\gamma_x[i]} \right)
$$
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- $\hat{\beta}_0$ is the intercept, $\hat{\beta}^{x}_{\gamma_x[i]}$ are coefficients for covariates $x$
     * age, sex, English language, white ethnicity, UK born, qualifications, income, job status, work role, home ownership
- $\gamma_x[i]$ represents the level or category for covariate $x$ for individual $i$. 
- IMD is included as multilevel random effects $\beta^{\text{IMD}}_j \sim \text{N}(\mu_{\text{IMD}}, \sigma_{\text{IMD}}^2)$
- Prior distributions for fixed effects normal distributions centered at zero with modest variance
- Half-normal priors are used for random effect standard deviations \cite{gelman2006}.
:::
:::::

## Mutlilevel Regression and [Post-stratification]{style="color: blue;"}

- The health literacy probabilities for each demographic category (cell $c$) are weighted by their proportion in the actual Newham population
- 11 covariates is 13,824 cells
- Post-stratified estimate is: $$
\hat{\pi}^{\text{mrp}} = \sum_{c = 1}^{|\mathcal{S}|} w_c \hat{\pi}_{c}
$$

- $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of all covariate combinations

- $N_c$ is the population frequency for cell $c$

- $N$ is the total population size

- $w_c = N_{c} / N$ are the combination weights


## Predictive comparisons :thinking:

-   Terminology borrow from @gelman2007average. Also called [predicted change in probability]{style="color: blue;"}
-   Previously, crops up in other fields e.g. @lee1981covariance ([covariance adjustment mean difference]{style="color: blue;"})
-   Like [average treatment effects]{style="color: blue;"} without the causal interpretation$$
\delta_u(u^{(1)}, u^{(2)}) = \frac{E(y \mid u^{(2)}) - E(y \mid u^{(1)})}{u^{(2)} - u^{(1)}}
$$

## Missing joint distributions

- [Raking / Iterative proportional fitting (IPF)]{style="color: blue;"}
    * Adjust survey weights so that the sample distribution matches known population control totals (margins)
- Census data $\rightarrow$ Marginals
- Labour Force Survey (LFS) $\rightarrow$ Covariance structure
- Overlap issues, non-representative
    * Data augmentation *before* IPF
    * Laplace smoothing *after* IPF
        * Like "zero cell" problem in meta-analyses


## Priority ranking

- Adopt [Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA)]{style="color: blue;"}
    * Common in multiple-treatment meta-analysis \cite{Salanti2011}
- Percentage of the maximum possible cumulative rank an intervention can achieve
- Providing a single value where a higher SUCRA indicates a better overall rank relative to others $$
\text{SUCRA}_{ij} = \sum_{r=1}^{n-1} P_{ijr} / (n-1),
$$


- where $P_{ijr}$ is the cumulative probability for variable $i$ at level $j$ and rank $r$
- The mean rank is $$
\mathbb{E}[\text{rank}(i,j)] = n - \sum_{r=1}^{n-1} P_{ijr}.
$$

## Main results :thumbsup:

![]()


## Sensitivity analyses :thumbsup:

-   Concern was raised that the relationship between the covariates and the health literacy outcomes may have [changed over time]{style="color: blue;"}
- So using SfL 2011 is not appropriate?

- Suggested more recent survey data PIAAC 2023
    * Missing data in PIAAC
    * Impute using covariate relationship in SfL 2011
        * Weaker assumption than with outcome
    
- Also fitted to SfL 2001 to see trend back in time

## Covariate imputation

- Covariate noise introduces [Dilution or Attenuation]{style="color: blue;"}, where signal is weakened
- [Uncongeniality]{style="color: blue;"} is when there is a mismatch between the imputation and the main model
    * Not including outcome essentially drop association with imputed covariates
- So [trade-off]{style="color: blue;"} between including outcome for congeniality and excluding because of temporal drift
- Perform sensitivity analysis by including additional noise to outcome
    * Equivalent to influence of [prior distribution]{style="color: blue;"} in Bayesian model
